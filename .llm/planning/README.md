# Planning Documents

This directory contains all planning documents for dotfiles refactoring and improvements.

## Active Plans

None currently active.

## Completed Plans

- **001-initial-refactor.md** (2025-10-05)
  - Status: Completed (Phases 1-2), Phase 3 deferred
  - Standardized script documentation, cleaned configs, simplified Brewfile
  - Added comprehensive README with post-bootstrap steps

## Naming Convention

Planning documents use sequential numbering: `NNN-descriptive-name.md`

The descriptive name should:
- Be kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
- Briefly describe the effort
- Match the git branch name used for implementation

**Example:**
- Planning doc: `001-initial-refactor.md`
- Git branch: `claude-refactor` or `initial-refactor`

This preserves chronological order and makes it easy to reference specific planning efforts.
